{"name":"Snowey","body":"## WIP\r\n\r\nThis project is very much in development, though the alpha-1 tag should host a relatively working version.\r\n\r\n# Snowey\r\n\r\nSnowey is a ruby based service for generating unique, incremental IDs in a distributed environment (say, load balanced application servers). It's based around a similar idea to [Twitter Snowflake](http://github.com/twitter/snowflake) or [Flake](http://github.com/boundary/flake) except it works on a range basis, each instance of Snowey will alloate itself a range of IDs to use, and re-allocate itself more when it runs out.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only atomic range store is based on DynamoDB. Support for something like Redis or MySQL might be worked in.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nEnsure you have rubygems installed, and ruby 1.9.3 or newer. To install the gem via rubygems\r\n\r\n    gem install snowey\r\n\r\nYou can compile and install them gem yourself with the following commands (rake required)\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/tarnfeld/snowey.git\r\n    cd snowey && rake install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo start up snowey, execute the following command. This will start a snowey server listening on all network interfaces on port 2478\r\n\r\n    snowey\r\n\r\nTo see available options, execute the following comand\r\n\r\n    snowey --help\r\n\r\n## Client Usage\r\n\r\nWhen you have an instance of Snowey up and running, you can issue commands via the listening TCP Socket.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nFor a real basic introduction, fire up your terminal and execute the following. You may need to modify the address or port if you've changed that.\r\n\r\n    telnet 0.0.0.0 2478\r\n\r\nNow you can begin typing in commands (see below) and get results.\r\n\r\n### Client Libraries\r\n\r\nI'll soon be working on a PHP client library for Snowey, but thats not built yet. If any body fancies building a client feel free to submit them to me and i'll list it here.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nHere's a short list of the available commands in Snowey...\r\n\r\n|Command|Arguments|Description|\r\n|:------|:--------|:----------|\r\n|ID|tag|Generate a unique identifier for the given tag. It is recommended you name your tag the same as your database table to help with namespacing|\r\n|INFO|tag|Display some information about a given tag, such as the current range, position etc.|\r\n|STATUS|n/a|Display a bit of information about the snowey system status|\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork Snowey\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
